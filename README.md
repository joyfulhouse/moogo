## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Integration not appearing**
- Ensure files are in `/config/custom_components/moogo/`
- Restart Home Assistant completely
- Check the logs for any error messages

**Authentication failures**
- Verify your Moogo account credentials
- Ensure your account has device access
- Check for rate limiting (24-hour lockout after multiple failed attempts)
- Try the public data mode first to test connectivity

**No device data**
- Confirm your devices are online in the Moogo mobile app
- Check if your account has the necessary permissions
- Review the integration logs for API errors

**Sensors not updating**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Moogo API service status
- Review coordinator update intervals in logs

**Sensors showing "Unknown"**
- Device may be offline - check device status sensor
- API may be temporarily unavailable
- Check integration logs for specific error messages

### Debug Logging

Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` for detailed logs:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.moogo: debug
    custom_components.moogo.moogo_api.client: debug
    custom_components.moogo.coordinator: debug
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Requirements

- Home Assistant 2023.1 or later
- Python 3.11 or later
